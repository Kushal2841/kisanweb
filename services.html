            <p class="SectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is provided by public schools (controlled and funded
                by three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under various articles of the Indian
                Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children between the
                ages of 6 and 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5.

            <p class="SectionSubTag text-small">In India, higher education is defined as the education of an age group
                between 18 and 24, and is largely funded by the government. Despite women making up 24â€“50% of higher
                education enrolment, there is still a gender imbalance within higher education. Only one third of
                science students and 7% of engineering students, are women. In comparison, however, over half the
                students studying Education are women.[1 </p>

            <p class="SectionSubTag text-small">India has made progress in increasing the attainment rate of primary
                education. In 2011, Approximately 75% of the population, aged between 7 and 10 years, was literate.[3]
                India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic
                development.[4] Much of the progress, especially in higher education and scientific research, has been
                credited to various public institutions. </p>
